# CS258 Assignment 3 – Mininet Experiments

This repository contains my submission for Assignment 3 of CS258.

## Files

- `exp1.py`: Mininet script for IP Routing (Experiment 1)
- `exp2.py`: Mininet script for SDN flow-based switching (Experiment 2)
- `result1.txt`: Output from running `exp1.py` with successful pings and routing
- `result2.txt`: Output from `exp2.py`, including manual flow rules, flow table dump, and ping results

## Notes

- `exp1.py` creates a routed topology with 3 hosts and 2 routers, using static routes.
- `exp2.py` builds a 2-switch SDN network. OpenFlow rules were added manually from a second terminal using `ovs-ofctl`, as required.
- All outputs were generated by running the scripts and capturing both ping and flow rule behavior.

## Result Summary

- `result1.txt`: All hosts successfully reach each other — 0% packet loss.
- `result2.txt`: 
  - h1 → h3:  SUCCESS
  - h2 → h3:  BLOCKED (as expected)
